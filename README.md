# Generals.io Tournaments

This is a tournament webapp for the game [generals.io](http://generals.io/). Tournaments will play in the arena style that [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/tournament) uses where the tournament runs for a set amount of time and the player with the most points at the end wins. You accumulate points based on your performance in the tournament. Chess is always 1v1, so there will be some custom logic in this tournament to handle the number of points given for games like FFA and 2v2. Custom game modes + maps may be supported in the future.
